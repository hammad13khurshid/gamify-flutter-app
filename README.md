# Gamify: A Flutter UI BootCamp Project

Welcome to my Flutter UI BootCamp project! ðŸš€

## Overview

I'm building this Flutter app by following the **Flutter UI BootCamp Course** on Udemy, taught by **Hussain Mustafa**. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and functional app using Flutter.

## Daily Progress

- **Modules**: I'll be breaking down the app into modules, focusing on specific features or screens.
- **Widgets**: I'll explore various Flutter widgets to build the user interface.
- **Features**: I'll implement features step by step, learning and improving along the way.
- **GitHub Updates**: I'll regularly update my GitHub repository with my progress as I complete each module or feature.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and follow along with my journey! Let's create something amazing together. ðŸŒŸ
